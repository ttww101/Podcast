# Ceres
An open-source iOS app for listening to podcasts.

In order to build this application you need to add a Keys.plist to the folder. 
Inside you need to specify a `fabric-api-key` and `fabric-build-secret`. To retrieve 
these you need to make an account and an app at [Fabric](http://fabric.io)'s website. 
Please be sure to change the Bundle Identifier in the General tab of the project settings.
